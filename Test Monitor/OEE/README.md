# Test Monitor OEE

The Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) example contains a dashboard that is bound to the "OEE Health.ipynb" notebook.  It calculates `availability`, `performance`, and `quality` to derive a combined `health` metric.  The dashboard shows the latest numeric values for each score as well as a chart which displays the OEE value for the last 30-days as a trend.
