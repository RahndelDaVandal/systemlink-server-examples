## Using systemlink-python-examples

### Jupyter examples

The **jupyter** folder contains Jupyter notebook examples that exercise the different SystemLink Services APIs (Tag, File, TDMReader and Test Montor). To be able to run these examples, you need to have the "NI SystemLink Server - JupyterHub Module" installed. From the Jupyter interface in SystemLink, you can drag and drop the jupyter folder, to upload the examples to the SystemLink server. Once the examples are uploaded, they will be runnable.
