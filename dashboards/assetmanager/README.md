# Asset Manager

The Assets Manager example contains a dashboard that is bound to the Asset Manager service to query for the total number of assets, total number of calibrated assets, number of active and inactive assets. The dashboard is bound to the `Connection History.ipynb` and `Asset Utilization.ipynb` to calculate the connection history and asset utilization for the last 30-days as a trend. The dashboard is also bound to the `Calibration Forecast.ipynb` to compute the number of assets that require calibration per month for the next 12 months.
